            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p>India is often called a Young Country because its youth forms
                the greatest section of the population and the country’s 
                future depends on its young students.
                Thanks to the <kbd>Exclusive Education System</kbd> which 
                kept Indians mugging (a+b)^2 having no importance in real
                life application.
                Financial literacy is very important for Indian youth because young people 
                today are ambitious and yearn to achieve great heights, 
                therefore it is very important that they are given proper 
                guidance regarding spending and investing money.

            <h3>What is financial literacy?</h3>
            <p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A budget is, simply put, a plan for your money. By tracking income and expenses you can create a plan for your spending and saving.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If you have ever found yourself looking at your bank account 
                    and wondering where your money went, a budget can help.
                    The most common cause of financial problems is spending more 
                    than you are earning. With a flexible, sensible budget, you
                    can control of your money and avoid financial stress. It can 
                    help you limit spending and ensure there is enough money to do 
                    the things that you want. 
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Get Started.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        1. Build a starting budget with your best guess of what you
                        spend in a month (on average), separated into categories like 
                        books, personal expenses, rent, phone, and entertainment.
                        <br>
                        2. Track your expenses for a few months. 
                        Then, compare these figures with your previous projections. 
                        You may be surprised to see where your guesses were higher or 
                        lower.
                        <br>
                        3. Review your monthly budget for any necessary changes. 
                        Remember: a budget is fluid, meaning that it will (and should) 
                        adjust as your income and goals adjust.

                    <p>Credit is a major factor in today's economy and is your reputation as a borrower.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Credit Score</strong></p>
                    <p>‘Credit Score’ in India is a defining aspect for all those applying for loans or credit cards at banks and other financial institutions.</p>
                    <p>
                        A credit score in India ranges from 300 to 900.
                    Scores above 750 are considered good to get approval for most
                    credits. Unsecured debts such as personal loans and credit 
                    cards require you to have a score of 750 and above. However, 
                    secured debts such as home loan and loan against property can
                    be financed with a lower score. Your home acts as a mortgage 
                    for the loan you get from lenders.

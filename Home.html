        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>India is often called a Young Country because its youth forms
            the greatest section of the population and the countryâ€™s 
            future depends on its young students.
            Thanks to the <kbd>Exclusive Education System</kbd> which 
            kept Indians mugging (a+b)^2 having no importance in real
            life application.
            Financial literacy is very important for Indian youth because young people 
            today are ambitious and yearn to achieve great heights, 
            therefore it is very important that they are given proper 
            guidance regarding spending and investing money.
        </p>

    <div class="container bg-success text-white border rounded p-3 my-3">
        <p>
            Students should be taught about importance of planning 
                their expenditure at an early stage, then only they will 
                spend their earned money maturely when time comes.

        <h3>What is financial literacy?</h3>
        <p>
            Have you all heard the story of "The Ant and the 
            Grasshopper"? Well if you haven't then please do because
            the Ant in the story is going to give you some amazing 
            finance management goals!
            The Ant in the tale is financially intellectual enough to 
            store the grain for bitter winter days. Yes, this is what being 
            financially literate means, you have your money when you need 
            it the most.
            It is your ability to make sane judgments while spending money 
            so that you face no resistance in managing and growing your 
            bucks. Financial literacy will help you to create a roadmap for 
            yourself, using which you can make sound earning and spending 
            decisions.
        </p>
